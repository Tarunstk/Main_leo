# Main_leo

I implemented the orbital mechanics algorithm using Cartesian Geometry which helps in tracing Low Earth Orbits (LEO) and track satellites that are in orbit.
- I came up with this algorithm while I was interning during my bachelors degree. 
- The next step is to make this runnable. 
  - I would probably implement this code in java or C++ in the near future using better data structures to improve time and space complexity.
